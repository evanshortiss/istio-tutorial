There are three different and super simple microservices in this system and they are chained together in the following sequence:

```
customer → preference → recommendation
```

== Local Development

Tested with Node.js v18.9.

```bash
# Clone the repository locally
git clone git@github.com:redhat-scholars/istio-tutorial.git
cd istio-tutorial

# Install antora dependencies
npm install

# Performs an initial build, then watches adoc files
# and rebuilds the site when they are modified
npm run dev
```

Open the _gh-pages/index.html_ to see the site. You can refresh to see your
changes if you modify _adoc_ files, since the `npm run dev` script will
automatically rebuild the site when it detects changes.
